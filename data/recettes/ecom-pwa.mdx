Another entrepreneurship trial for two months.

## Why I started it

I have a friend who was running a digital marketing firm in India.
Some of his clients were small merchants who used to run their site using WordPress and didn't have enough IT staff or budget to enhance it.
The friend's firm used to run Facebook ads. A common problem was that the mobile internet speed was slow.
The merchant site wouldn't load fast enough to convert the click into order.
I decided to introduce a static PWA - Progressive Web App to enhance customer experience. The PWA would get data from static json files.
A scraper program would visit the original merchant site and create the json files for the products for which Facebook ads were shown.
The customers would then add some of those products to the cart on PWA and it would then take the customer to the main merchant site for checkout.

Some initial conversations -

## Did it succeed?

The Proof of Concept worked like a charm. However It was hard to convince the merchants to give extra money to have the PWA app developed.
Friend's firm didn't have enough eCommerce customers that he would want to invest in building an automated platform.
With improving digital infrastructure in India the problem we were solving would have been solved on its own after a few months.
So we decided not to pursue the idea.

## Learnings

On the technical front, I added some experience with WordPress and AWS (used S3 buckets for the static site and Lambda for scraper).
On the business side, I got to know how hard it is to sell something.
