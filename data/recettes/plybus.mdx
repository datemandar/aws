### An entrepreneurship trial - though it was not successful, it was the best learning experience so far.

The demo Rider app can be accessed using below URL.

Below is the URL for the admin app. Note that it is only a static prototype. I did not get a chance to host the java API and MYSQL database to make it work.

## Why I started it

In 2014 I worked from India for eight months. I used to take the transportation bus provided by my employer to commute.
The experiences that got motivated me to make the commute more predictive and pleasant. I faced these problems that I hoped to resolve -

- The bus schedule was available only in an excel spreadsheet. Not at all mobile-friendly.
- The stop names were vague and based on landmarks. A rider wouldn't know the landmarks unless they knew the city very well.
- Bus schedule would often change, the riders wouldn't know about it until they see company email.
- The riders had to carry a physical bus pass. Forgetting the bus pass created hassles after boarding the bus. A designated employee worked as a ticket checker. There was no easy way to verify the subscription.
- Subscribing/unsubscribing to the service was tedious. The rider had to contact office administrative staff in person and had to do physical paperwork.
- Buses used to come late often. The riders had no way to know if the bus was ever going to come. They had to call the bus coordinator, who would then call the bus driver. There was no way to accurately tell how late the bus was to the riders waiting at various stops along the route.
- Vehicle assigned to route would sometime change. Riders were often left confused and couldn't identify the bus in heavy traffic.

Below is a snapshot of the business plan that I was discussing with the developers. We used Slack as the medium of communication.

# Amazon Leadership Principles -

The entrepreneurial venture is a good case study to showcase the leadership principles I followed.

Assignments at a job may not always give opportunities to follow the principles as there are limiting factors like pre-defined requirements, procedures, budget, hierarchy, etc.

## Customer Obsession -

Unfortunately I didn't get any real customer. However I tried my best to reach out to pilot customers to get their feedback.

The feedback was good overall, everybody who saw it liked the application but they couldn't use it without real data.

## Ownership -

Needless to say, I was the sole founder of this startup. I hired two fresh-out-of-college students to help me out.

## Invent and Simplify -

Though I had to leave the application unfinished due to logistical issues involved in operating it remotely, the idea was innovative and would have worked.
The opportunity cost was too high to pursue it.

## Are Right, A Lot -

Instincts come from experiences and knowledge. I spent a good amount of time reading books related to startups before I started building the application.
The learnings helped me do the right things like -

- Focus on MVP
- Getting full-time and fully committed developers instead of contractors
- Defer setting up a legal entity till I got paying customer
- Not spending time and money in the wrong direction like securing a patent
- Last but not least when to wind it down

Some notable books -

- Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future. By: Peter Thiel , Blake Masters
- The Art of the Start 2.0: The Time-Tested, Battle-Hardened Guide for Anyone Starting Anything. By: Guy Kawasaki
- The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses. By: Eric Ries
- The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon. By: Brad Stone
- The Sales Bible: The Ultimate Sales Resource. By: Jeffrey Gitomer
- The Virgin Way: Everything I Know about Leadership. By: Richard Branson

## Learn and Be Curious -

I used technologies that I didn't use at work - android, polymer js, java spring boot, cloud infra, etc., since I thought they were better choices than
the .net technologies that I was using at work.

## Hire and Develop the Best -

I first tried to hire contractors against common wisdom. I didn't find them worth the money after interviewing them.
I was then able to convince two students to join me. They had finished their studies and were waiting for their job offers. Both of them were at their best at academics.
It was a win-win situation. If the venture were to be successful, they would have become founders with me.
At least they got experience on a real-time project which helped them get a job after we wound down the startup.
I taught them everything I knew. It helped them in their careers. They still are in contact with me and seek guidance from me.

## Insist on the Highest Standards -

I built the application to solve the problem I faced. So I knew the customer's pain.
To the best of my abilities, I insisted highest standards to make it user-friendly.
I applied all my coding skills and best practices to build the application, e.g. source code repository, test coverage, modular code, etc.

## Think Big -

I started it as a bus scheduling platform with a plan was to introduce the carpooling facility for those who preferred to use their vehicle.
In the longer term, the vision was to streamline all the local corporate travel needs.
For example, airport drops, taxi vendor management, a platform for bus driver safety and well-being, etc.

## Bias for Action -

Even before I started, I knew it would be challenging to run a business remotely.
I was ready to do it full time if I had got a favorable response. So took the risk to spend my free time learning new skills and toiling to build the application.
The results were not what I had wished, but the experience was worth the effort.

## Frugality -

I spent a total of $300 which included the cost of buying a used laptop for one of the two developers, buying a domain, international phone calls, etc.

## Earn Trust -

The fact speaks for itself that the two developers trusted me and worked for me for free.
They were ready to work full time on this venture even when it meant letting go of their lucrative job offers.

## Dive Deep -

The rider application was almost ready, and we were satisfied that it worked well in the browsers that we tested and devices we tested in simulation mode.
I was still skeptical if that was enough testing since the target users would use it on a variety of mobile devices.
So I shared the application link with friends and family members, which revealed additional problems.
For example, some android phones that people used came with modified chrome or firefox browsers, and the application wouldn't load in them.
I had to use additional polyfills and fix alignment issued on various phone forms.

## Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit -

There was nobody to disagree with other than the two junior developers. I, however, knew the importance of this principle and insisted that the developers follow it.

## Deliver Results -

I can't claim I fully delivered results, but I still believe that what I built was of good quality and would have solved the commuters' problems.

## Strive to be Earth's Best Employer -

I taught the two developers a lot which helped them get a headstart in their careers. They still see me as a mentor and often seek help.
I provided critical but constructive feedback for their work so that they could adapt and improve.

## Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility -

Though I didn't achieve success or scale in the venture, I aimed to do whatever I could to make the bus commute easy and reliable.
I knew if this was successful would attract more riders who otherwise preferred to use private vehicles on already inadequate road infrastructure.
Lesser vehicles would mean reduced avoidable pollution and stress.
