I consistently received negative feedback till five years ago about my weak verbal communication skills.
Though it was not a surprise to me, I didn't give up. The feedbacks kept me driving to try harder. I have come a long way after that.
Last week I was asked to give a demo of the application I am building to the entire IT department in the presence of the CIO. It was well-received.
