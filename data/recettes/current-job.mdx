In the current job I build and support business-critical applications for 15,000+ front and back-office users to run a $2 trillion+ wealth management business.
I play roles ranging from solo roles like developer, business analyst, and L3 support person to those with more responsibilities like an application architect or a manager for a geographically distributed team of up to 6 people.
